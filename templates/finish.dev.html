        <li>You were on puzzle {{ tampered[2] }} of {{ tampered[0] }}</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This doesn't seem right now does it. Unfortunately, you will not be receiving a reward for you cheating. However mad props to you for finding a bug this serious. I will be emailing you from <a href="mailto:krantzie124@gmail.com">krantzie124@gmail.com</a> regarding how you found this bug.</p>
